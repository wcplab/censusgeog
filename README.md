This repository contains information on how to choose the correct type of local geography (Incorporated Place or County Subdivision) for each state. It is especially useful for those doing research on the national scale using local-level Census data.

## References
This guide uses the 2010 Census Geographies guide and the 2017 Census of Governments guide to identify which geography type is best for local-level research on governmental units in each state

## A note on terminology
Census Places do no entirely cover each state and are instead based on population centers and local knowledge of communities. County Subdivisions (CSD) are used to break down each county entirely into sub-county units, either governmentally or for statistical purposes.

Census Places are either incorporated places like cities (varying by state), or Census Designated Places. CDPs are statistical only and often represent population centers without a central government, such as small unincorporated towns that are governed by a broader unit such as a township or county.

Census County Subdivisions are either a state's own governmental divisions - called Minor Civil Divisions - or Census County Divisions (Census Subareas in Alaska). CCDs are defined by the Census in the absence of a sub-county government structure encompassing the entire county. As a result, they are statistical designations only. "County subdivisions not defined" are divisions made entirely of water.

Where the same geography is included in both Place and County Subdivision, always use the Place geography. Because CSDs are strictly based on the encompassing counties, any municipality that spans across a county line will be split into two entries.

Each state has different governmental structures based on cities, towns, townships, and other types of local governments. Typically, CDPs and CCDs should be excluded when doing research on local governments because they are Census defined areas that do not have functioning governments. Each state also has certain governments that have their own municipal structure although they are still dependent on a larger sub-county government. For example, villages in Michigan have their own charter but still pay taxes to the surrounding township. In many cases, these dependent municipalities are the population centers of larger rural townships, having chartered their own government to supply services such as utilities and trash removal.
